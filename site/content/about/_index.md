summary: We were the first to apply behavioral economics to healthcare
introduction: Faculty and researchers from across the University of Pennsylvania and other renowned institutions have conducted and continue to research direct patient engagement and behavioral economics based interventions aimed at reducing the disease burden from major U.S. public health problems. Way to Health was born from their frustration around the lack of a platform to quickly develop, test and scale out their ideas.
introtitle: Our mission
introsubtitle: To enable everyone to enjoy healthy lives through research, personalized engagement and learning from the experience of every patient.
introtext: We exist to enable clinicians and researchers to serve patients by making their ideas come to life.

    - title: Improving healthcare outcomes needs purpose built research tools
      image: /images/build.svg
      summary: > 
        Technology assisted motivation & human behavior change is the key to advancing health outcomes. The healthcare system needs a purpose built tool that allows for scale and to engage with people in their existing journeys. Way to Health has demonstrated its value as a research platform in this domain.  The platform, its developers, and its uses have credibility among the research community. 
    - title: Successes derived from research should be easily translated into practice
      image: /images/practice.svg
      summary: >
        Even as more research and successes are published, its application in the real world still lags as systems and plans don’t quite know how to apply it in their context. THe goal is to reduce the time it takes for interventional research to be applied in specific patient contexts as short as possible. We want to take a leadership position in tactical research and deployment of evidence based research.
    - title: EHRs should be an integral part of any patient or provider engagement strategy
      image: /images/ehr.svg
      summary: >
        Good technology must join not just patient and physician journeys, but also their existing technology, such as legacy EHR systems i.e. be available  in the context of their life and their “workflow”. Tighter integration with EHRs is necessary. Health systems have spent millions deploying and customizing EHRs. They are looking for ways to maximize the ROI. This will be a platform available to all irrespective of the EHR of choice.
    - title: Support programs from conception to scale and standard of care
      image: /images/support_programs.svg
      summary: >
        Program requirements change as they grow and evolve. We will provide software and services to help organizations (internal as well as external) build, test, iterate and integrate to service their patient and provider needs. We will do so as efficiently and effectively as possible, while remaining a non-profit organization.

origins:
  heading: Origins
  para1: Drs. David Asch and Kevin Volpp conceptualized Way to Health back in 2010. It was born from their frustration around the lack of a platform to quickly develop, test and scale out their ideas to improve health care for patients.
  para2: Since then, more than 50 faculty and researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and other renowned institutions have conducted and continue to research direct patient engagement and behavioral economics based interventions aimed at reducing the disease burden from major U.S. public health problems.
