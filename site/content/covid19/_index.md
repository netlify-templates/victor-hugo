        subtitle1: COVID Watch
        description1: With the move to value based care (VBC) and increased risk bearing contracts, proven solutions to reduce readmissions are needed. Leverage evidence based programs such as Heart Safe Motherhood that have reduced readmissions by 80%.
        subtitle2: COVID Pulse
        description2: With the downward pressure on costs and the increasing importance of telemedicine and remote monitoring, proven solutions focused on specific domains will allow organizations to roll out programs systematically. 
        subtitle3: Pregnancy Watch
        description3: With the increased prevalence of consumer driven healthcare, ratings and reviews are increasingly important in health care decisions. Programs available are continuously monitored and consistently measure in the 80s and 90s for patient satisfaction while maintaining or improving quality of care.

        subtitle1: Automated Results Reporting
        description1: Innovation and research require flexibility. Integration with the EHR opens up additional opportunities. Trials can be run locally or virtually. Way to Health has run virtual studies across 50 states. 
        subtitle2: Telemedicine Prep Bot
        description2: Innovation should be backed by evidence. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the gold standard to generate evidence in healthcare. Our background and genesis can help guide the the setup of innovation projects to gather data to support (or reject) hypotheses. Automation built into the system can help doing this quickly and minimize personnel costs. 
        subtitle3: Penn Partners in Care
        description3: Research and innovation are usually constrained by cost and/or time. Our library of proven projects can serve as a base to help achieve quick successes. Open inboxes can help engage patients directly to gather data to understand patient needs. These can then be automated as needed.

    #     subtitle1: Increase adherence to wellness programs
    #     description1: With roots in behavioral science, population health and wellness, our research has been geared towards improving adherence to programs that members might not always want to adhere to. Programs such as smoking cessation have been proven to be successful and are the standard at organizations such as GE, CVS and others. 
    #     subtitle2: Offer evidence backed protocols
    #     description2: In an increasingly competitive market, offering unique and proven programs is important. Our programs are differentiated by evidence, practical experience and operational expertise. 
    #     subtitle3: Innovate at scale
    #     description3: 1, 10, 10000 - the volume of members is irrelevant. What we enable is tailoring programs to latent member groups to maximize engagement and adherence.
