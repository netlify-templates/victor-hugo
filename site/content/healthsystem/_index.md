    - heading: Reduce readmissions
      summary: With the move to value based care (VBC) and increased risk bearing contracts, proven solutions to reduce readmissions is critical. Leverage evidence based models to reduce readmissions in your context. Programs such as Heart Safe Motherhood have shown readmisions reductions from 5% to 1%.
    - heading: Increase pre and post procedure adherence
      summary: While VBC is important, a significant portion of revenue is still dependent on procedures. Whether it is colonoscopy prep or post joint replacement surgery, programs such as Engaged Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) have been proven and shown to increase adherence while still achieving 80+ Net Promoter Score (NPS) ratings.
    - heading: Increase capacity
      summary: With evidence based remote monitoring protocols, programs such as CARE have enabled departments to increase capacity by up to 35% while increasing patient NPS ratings to 90+ and maintaining quality of service.
