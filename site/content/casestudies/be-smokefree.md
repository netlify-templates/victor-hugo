summary: 'Adolescents will be randomized to 1 of 3 financial incentive groups: (1) reward-based, with each adolescent receiving incremental $15-45 payments submitted into a virtual account when program benchmarks for the Quitline are achieved (maximum $150); (2) loss-framed, with $150 deposited into a virtual account, with $15-45 losses deducted from the account for each benchmark not achieved, with withdrawal only allowed at the end of the study; and (3) no financial incentive. The Quitline is funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Health and staffed by trained cessation counselors available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.'
