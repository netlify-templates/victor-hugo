summary: >
  Levarege the W2H platform to develop and evaluate a new hypertension
  service-delivery model that is integrated with routine clinical care at Penn
  Family Care (PFC), an academic family medicine practice in West Philadelphia.
  Among patients with poorly controlled HTN, we will assess the effects of
  monitoring blood pressure and medication adherence with feedback to the patient
  and to the clinical practice, as needed if out of control. We will also compare
  the impact of providing feedback to a social support partner with what we call
  facilitated cheer leading.
