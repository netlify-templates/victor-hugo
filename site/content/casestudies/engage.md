summary: >
  The purpose of this study is to determine how goal-setting in the context of
  gamification affects habit formation for physical activity among participants
  who are overweight or obese. We plan to use the gamification features of the Way
  to Health platform and the step tracking feature of to test the impact of two
  separate goal-setting features including 1. actively choosing a step goal versus
  being assigned a step goal and 2. being asked to immediately meet that goal
  versus being asked to make incremental changes towards that goal over an 8 week
  period.
