      A Randomized Controlled Trial of Opt-In Versus Opt-Out Enrollment Into a
      Diabetes Behavioral Intervention.

## Aim

To examine the effect of an opt-out default recruitment strategy compared to a conventional opt-in strategy on enrollment and adherence to a behavioral intervention for poorly controlled diabetic patients.

## Intervention and Design:

This was a randomized controlled trial looking at University of Pennsylvania primary care practices. Participants of this trial included those with (1) age 18 to 80 years; (2) diabetes diagnosis; and (3) a measured hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) greater than 8% in the past 12 months.

**Intervention** - They randomized eligible patients into opt-in and opt-out arms prior to enrollment. Those in the opt-out arm received a letter stating that they were enrolled into a diabetes research study with the option to opt out, and those in the opt-in arm received a standard recruitment letter.

**Main Outcomes and Measures** - Main end points include enrollment rate, defined as the proportion of participants who attended the baseline visit, and adherence to daily glycemic monitoring.

## Way to Health Use

- **Study Enrollment**: Enroll and randomize participants in the study

- **Enrollment Tracking**: Track enrollment numbers across all arms

## Findings and Conclusions

Of the 569 eligible participants who received a recruitment letter, 496 were randomized to the opt-in arm and 73 to the opt-out arm. Enrollment rates were 38% in the opt-out arm and 13% in the opt-in arm ( P < .001).

Opt-out defaults, where clinically appropriate, could be a useful approach for increasing the generalizability of low-risk trials testing behavioral interventions in clinical settings.
