Welcome to my website. I've been meaning to put together a site where I can write down my thoughts for a while now.  I've started and stopped a few times, and tried out different platforms along the way.  I'm pretty excited about this one, so hopefully it sticks.  I'm still mesing around with it, but so far it's been super easy to work with.  In the first real post I'll explain the tools and frameworks, as well as the service I'm using to host it.
