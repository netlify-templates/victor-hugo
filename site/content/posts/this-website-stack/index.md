The registrar for this website is [hover](https://www.hover.com/). The site is generated using the [victor hugo netlify template](https://github.com/netlify-templates/victor-hugo) and is statically deployed using [netlify's](https://netlify.com) continuous github integration.

The [victor hugo netlify template](https://github.com/netlify-templates/victor-hugo) lets me use modern es6 javascript which I used to create the
animation in the background.
