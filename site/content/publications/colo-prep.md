summary: >-
  Background. Numerous barriers to outpatient colonoscopy completion exist,
  causing undue procedure cancellations and poor bowel preparation. We piloted a
  text message navigation program to improve colonoscopy adherence. Method. We
  conducted a prospective study of patients aged 18 to 75 years scheduled for
  outpatient colonoscopy at an urban endoscopy center in April 2018. An
  intervention arm consisting of bidirectional, automated text messages prior to
  the procedure was compared with a usual care arm. We enrolled 21 intervention
  patients by phone and randomly selected 50 controls. Outcomes included
  colonoscopy appointment adherence, bowel preparation quality, and colonoscopy
  completion. Results. The arms had similar demographics and comorbidities.
  Intervention patients had higher colonoscopy appointment adherence (90% vs.
  62%, p = 0.049). There were no significant differences in preparation quality
  or procedure completeness. Poststudy surveys indicated high patient
  satisfaction and perceived usefulness of the program. Conclusion. A
  bidirectional, automated texting navigation program improved colonoscopy
  adherence rates as compared with usual care.
