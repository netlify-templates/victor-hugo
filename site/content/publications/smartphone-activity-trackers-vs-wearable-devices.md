summary: >-
  According to a new Penn Medicine Study, doctors who track their patients’
  physical activity might have more luck doing it with smartphones than wearable
  fitness devices. “Most people with smartphones take them everywhere they go.
  Since carrying the phone is already a built-in habit, it makes it much easier
  to use the device to track activity levels,” says Mitesh Patel, the director
  of Penn Medicine’s Nudge Unit.
