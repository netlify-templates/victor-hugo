summary: >-
  PCPs participating in a P4P program generally agree with the concept of financial incentives and are open to sharing incentives between physicians and patients. Physician beliefs about incentives may have an influence on patient outcomes, particularly in a shared incentive setting, but more research is needed to elucidate the exact nature of this interaction.
