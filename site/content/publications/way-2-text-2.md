  Electronic Pill Bottles or Bidirectional Text Messaging to Improve
  Hypertension Medication Adherence (Way 2 Text): a Randomized Clinical Trial
date: '2019-08-08'
summary: >-
  Despite good measured adherence, neither feedback with electronic pill bottles
  nor bidirectional text messaging about medication adherence improved blood
  pressure control. Adherence to prescribed medications was not improved enough
  to affect BP control or it was not the primary driver of poor control.
