  Association between behavioral phenotypes and response to a physical activity
  intervention using gamification and social incentives: Secondary analysis of
  the STEP UP randomized clinical trial
date: '2020-10-14'
summary: >-
  Participants often vary in their response to behavioral interventions, but
  methods to identify groups of participants that are more likely to respond are
  lacking. In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, we used
  baseline characteristics to group participants into distinct behavioral
  phenotypes and evaluated differential responses to a physical activity
  intervention. Engagement varies significantly across the identified
  phenotypes. The hope is to levarege this methodology to improve patient
  engagement across multiple clinical domains.
