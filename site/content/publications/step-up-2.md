  Incentives for Increasing Physical Activity Among Overweight and Obese Adults
  Across the United States

summary: >-
  Small changes to the design of gamification can lead to important differences
  in effectiveness - In this randomized clinical trial of 602 overweight and
  obese adults from 40 states across the United States, gamification
  interventions with support, collaboration, and competition significantly
  increased physical activity compared with the control group during the 24-week
  intervention. The competition arm had the greatest increase in physical
  activity from baseline during the intervention; during the 12-week follow-up,
  physical activity was lower in all arms, but remained significantly greater in
  the competition arm than in the control arm.
