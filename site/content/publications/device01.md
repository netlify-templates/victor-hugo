  Accuracy of Smartphone Applications and Wearable Devices for Tracking Physical Activity Data
date: '2015-02-10'
summary: >-
  Many smartphone applications and wearable devices were accurate for tracking step counts. Data from smartphones were only slightly different than observed step counts, but could be higher or lower. Wearable devices differed more and 1 device reported step counts more than 20% lower than observed. Step counts are often used to derive other measures of physical activity, such as distance or calories burned. Underlying differences in device accuracy may be compounded in these measures.
