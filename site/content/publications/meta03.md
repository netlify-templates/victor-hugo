  Wearable Devices as Facilitators, Not Drivers, of Health Behavior Change
date: '2015-02-03'
summary: >-
  The notion is that by recording and reporting information about behaviors such as physical activity or sleep patterns, these devices can educate and motivate individuals toward better habits and better health. The gap between recording information and changing behavior is substantial, however, and while these devices are increasing in popularity, little evidence suggests that they are bridging that gap.
