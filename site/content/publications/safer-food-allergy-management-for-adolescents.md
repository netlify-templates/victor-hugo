summary: >-
  Adolescents and young adults with food allergies are at increased risk of
  adverse events, including death from anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is the
  cornerstone of emergency response, yet few individuals with serious food
  allergies consistently carry their emergency medication.  A mixed-methods
  randomized controlled trial in young adults with food allergies investigated
  the carrying of epinephrine auto-injectors using financial incentives plus
  text message reminders vs text message reminders alone. Epinephrine carriage
  was assessed 10 times during the 49-day intervention using rapid-reply cell
  phone photographs plus daily code words. Although the intervention and control
  groups reported favorable impressions of text message-based reminder systems,
  the intervention group performed significantly better than the control group
  on a photograph-based measurement of epinephrine carriage.
