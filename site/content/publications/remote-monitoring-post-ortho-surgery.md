date: '2020-12-21'
summary: >-
  In this randomized clinical trial of 242 patients, the remote monitoring
  program did not increase rate of discharge to home after hip and knee
  arthroplasty, and gamification and social support did not increase activity
  levels. However, a significant reduction in rehospitalizations among those
  assigned to the intervention was found.
