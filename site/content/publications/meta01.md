  Cost-effectiveness of Financial Incentives for Patients and Physicians to
  Manage Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels
date: '2018-12-12'
summary: >-
  This study suggests that the financial incentives shared between patients and
  physicians for LDL-C level control meet conventional standards of
  cost-effectiveness, but these results appeared to be sensitive to assumptions
  about the durations of LDL-C level reductions and years of intervention costs
  included, as well as to the choice of time horizon.
