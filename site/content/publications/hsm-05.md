  Text message remote monitoring reduced racial disparities in postpartum blood
  pressure ascertainment

summary: >-
  Although nonblack women attended in-office (usual care) postpartum blood
  pressure checks twice as often as black women, the use of a text-based
  monitoring system resulted in overall higher compliance (>90%) in both race
  groups and no racial differences in blood pressure ascertainment. Given that
  most strokes and maternal morbidity from pregnancy-related hypertension occur
  within 10 days of delivery, text messaging has the potential to be an
  innovative way to engage hypertensive women of all races equally shortly after
  delivery and may be further evaluated as a means to reduce disparities in
  other aspects of postpartum care.
