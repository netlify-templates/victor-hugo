summary: >-
  Our group is using gamification to help patients with uncontrolled diabetes,
  heart disease, and cancer. We have found that incorporating principles from
  behavioral economics is not hard or expensive, but instead requires attention
  to detail. Subtle changes to program design and communications can have an
  outsized impact on how patients behave. That’s why embedding behavioral
  insights into gamification could represent a significant opportunity to
  improve health and wellbeing.
