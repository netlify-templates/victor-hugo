  Loss‐Framed Financial Incentives and Personalized Goal‐Setting to Increase
  Physical Activity Among Ischemic Heart Disease Patients Using Wearable
  Devices: The ACTIVE REWARD Randomized Trial
date: '2018-06-21'
summary: >-
  ACTIVE REWARD was a 24‐week home‐based, remotely monitored, randomized trial
  with a 16‐week intervention (8‐week ramp‐up incentive phase and 8‐week
  maintenance incentive phase) and an 8‐week follow‐up. Patients used wearable
  devices to track step counts and establish a baseline. Patients in control
  received no other interventions.  Loss‐framed financial incentives with
  personalized goal setting significantly increased physical activity among
  ischemic heart disease patients using wearable devices during the 16‐week
  intervention, and effects were sustained during the 8‐week follow‐up.
