summary: >-
  Daily behaviors play a significant role in individuals' longer-term health
  [4,5]. However, most readmission prediction models do not include data about
  these behaviors. Our trial has demonstrated that collecting these types of
  data is feasible. The use of wearable technology allowed for remote monitoring
  of patient generated physical activity data which provided reliable data, was
  easy to use, and scaled. The findings from this study will help to understand
  the ways in which these data sources can improve the identification of
  patients at high-risk of hospital readmission.
