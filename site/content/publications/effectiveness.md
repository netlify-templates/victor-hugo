  Effectiveness of Financial Incentives for Longer-Term Smoking Cessation: Evidence of Absence or Absence of Evidence?
date: '2012-04-15'
summary: >-
  This study highlights that in the context of smoking cessation we have much to learn about the effectiveness of incentives; what is clear is that the current literature provides inadequate evidence to make a determination. More adequately powered studies that test variations in incentive design, magnitude, and payment schedule are needed to determine the effectiveness of this approach in increasing the rate of smoking cessation.
