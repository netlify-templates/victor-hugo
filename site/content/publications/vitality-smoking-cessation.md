summary: >-
  The study randomly assigned 6006 smokers employed by 54 companies to one of
  four smoking-cessation interventions or to usual care. In this pragmatic trial
  of smoking cessation, financial incentives added to free cessation aids
  resulted in a higher rate of sustained smoking abstinence than free cessation
  aids alone. Among smokers who received usual care (information and
  motivational text messages), the addition of free cessation aids or
  e-cigarettes did not provide a benefit.
