  Upcoming Doctor’s Appointment

summary: >-
  Powered by Way to Health, this study was run at Penn Medicine and Geisinger.
  In the fall of 2020, close to 50,000 patients received one of 19 different
  messages prior to a healthy visit to their primary care provider. In the new
  study, roughly a third of the messages BCFG tested significantly increased flu
  shot uptake.  The top performing message set—designed by Jon Bogard, Craig
  Fox, Jehan Sparks, and Megan Weber from the University of California at Los
  Angeles, and Matt Hilchey, Melanie Kim, Dilip Soman, and Renante Rondina from
  the University of Toronto, in collaboration with BCFG—boosted vaccination
  rates by 11%.
