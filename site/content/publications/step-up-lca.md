  Weight Loss Intervention

summary: >-
  Latent class analysis was used to identify patient sub-groups that were
  successfully impacted by the study intervention. Three groups of participants
  were identified: “Kin teams,” “Distant teams,” and “Married teams.” “Kin
  teams” lost more weight after the intervention in the gamification and
  gamification with PCP sharing arms. The “Distant teams” lost similar amounts
  of weight in all 3 arms but did not keep it off during maintenance. The
  “Married teams” lost the most weight across all 3 arms and kept it off
  following the intervention.
