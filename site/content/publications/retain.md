  Randomized evaluation of trial acceptability by INcentive (RETAIN): Study
  protocol for two embedded randomized controlled trials.

summary: >-
  The most common and conceptually sound ethical concerns with financial
  incentives for research participation are that they may (1) represent undue
  inducements by blunting peoples' perceptions of research risks, thereby
  preventing fully informed consent; or (2) represent unjust inducements by
  encouraging enrollment preferentially among the poor. Neither of these
  concerns has been shown to manifest in studies testing the effects of
  incentives on decisions to participate in hypothetical randomized clinical
  trials (RCTs), but neither has been assessed in real RCTs.
