introtitle: Leverage our experience and capabilities to quickly design and deploy RCTs at scale
introsubtitle: We have supported 202 research studies across all 50 states in partnership with over 30 research institutions to-date. 
introtext: With rapid implementation times and multiple available modules for eConsent, randomizations, arm management, data collection and messaging, RCTs can be built and scaled as needed locally and virtually.

    - heading: Design any interventional study
      summary: Trials tend to be unique. While there are common elements (consenting, randomization), there are always unique elements to a study such as gamification, incentives, cohort management and more. We have substantial experience in design and implementation and can leverage our libraries of programs and surveys to quickly get a program up and running in a matter of weeks including testing. 
    - heading: Automate multiple aspects of running an RCT
      summary: Some of our researchers call us RedCap on steroids. We can automate and manage multiple aspects of running a trial so that small teams can simultaneously manage multiple studies. This is evidenced by the productivity of the [CHIBE](https://chibe.upenn.edu/publications/?wpvresourcecategory=way-to-health), and [Nudge Unit](https://nudgeunit.upenn.edu/portfolio) teams as examples.
    - heading: Run everything from a K award to an R01
      summary: We are embedded within an academic research institution and fully appreciate the challenges of funding. Our [mission](/about) is to serve as many researchers as possible and make research as efficient as possible.
