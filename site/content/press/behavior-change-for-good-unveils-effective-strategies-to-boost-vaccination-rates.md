  At Penn Medicine and Geisinger, BCFG conducted its study in collaboration with
  Christopher Chabris and Michelle Meyer (co-directors of the Geisinger
  Behavioral Insights Team). In the fall of 2020, close to 50,000 patients
  received one of 19 different messages prior to a healthy visit to their
  primary care provider. In the new study, roughly a third of the messages BCFG
  tested significantly increased flu shot uptake. The Penn and Geisinger studies
  were fully powered by Way to Health including integrations with the respective
  Epic based EHRs.
