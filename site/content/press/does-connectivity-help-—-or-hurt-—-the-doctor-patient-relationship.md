title: Does Connectivity Help — or Hurt — the Doctor-Patient Relationship?
date: 2017-09-26T12:26:10-04:00
summary: >-
  Christian Terwiesch, a Wharton professor of operations, information and
  decisions, has co-authored two new studies related to technology and health
  care. The first, which examined the impact of e-visits on primary care, found
  some surprisingly negative results about connectivity: E-visits can take up
  more of a physician’s time rather than making patient contacts simpler and
  more efficient. That has contributed to more physicians feeling overburdened
  and burnt out, with less ability to take on new patients. The second paper
  looked at how some of those negative effects could be turned around. Terwiesch
  sat down with Knowledge@Wharton to talk about these topics, which he describes
  as a “hot area” that sits at the intersection of medicine and management.
