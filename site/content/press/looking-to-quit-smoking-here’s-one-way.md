title: Looking to quit smoking? Hereâ€™s one way
date: '2018-06-01'
summary: >-
  This is the Vitality Smoking study. A recent study published in the New
  England Journal of Medicine looked at different strategies to quit smoking,
  and while it found that none of them work all that well, even in conjunction,
  a multi-faceted approach works best. The study found that offering a reward of
  $600 to quit for six months increased success rates two-fold, or three-fold in
  some sub-groups.
