  As healthcare organizations strive to keep up with changes in the medical world, Penn Medicine in Philadelphia is taking its own approach to innovation with the help of a homegrown platforms that seek to help improve patient care such as Way To Health. The platform, Way to Health, can collect data from various sources, including scales, Fitbits, connected pill bottles and patient texting. Through it, Penn Medicine can stay connected to patients after they leave the premises. The name of the tool — Way to Health — is actually a nod to the history of Philadelphia, as Benjamin Franklin wrote an essay called “The Way to Wealth.”
