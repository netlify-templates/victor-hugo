  This is the Active Reward study. "Framing rewards as a loss -- a technique
  from behavioral economics -- led to a meaningful difference in behavior," said
  Dr. Mitesh Patel, an assistant professor of Medicine and Health Care
  Management, and director of the Penn Medicine Nudge Unit. "During the 6-month
  trial, the average patient in the intervention arm had step counts that
  totaled about 100 miles more than the average patient in control."
