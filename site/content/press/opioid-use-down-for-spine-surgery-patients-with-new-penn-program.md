summary: >-
  As opioid addiction has reached crisis proportions, surgeons in a variety of
  fields have worked to reduce the need for opioids after procedures, in the
  hope that fewer patients would become dependent on or addicted to pain pills..
  A comprehensive program designed to improve the quality of care for spine and
  peripheral nerve surgery patients reduced patients' opioid use at one month
  after surgery without increasing pain.
