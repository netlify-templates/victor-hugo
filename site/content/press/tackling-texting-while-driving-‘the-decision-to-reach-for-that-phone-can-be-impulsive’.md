  Tackling Texting While Driving: ‘The Decision to Reach for That Phone Can Be
  Impulsive’
date: '2019-08-01'
summary: >-
  Years of treating people who have been hurt in distracted driving crashes is a
  big reason why Delgado is researching this topic. He’s heading up a
  multimillion-dollar grant, one of the largest ever funded by the federal
  government, to figure out the best ways to use technology to help drivers put
  down their phones. The research team includes experts from the fields of
  medicine, behavioral economics, psychology, insurance and technology. They
  hope their work leads to the development of more smartphone programs that can
  nudge drivers into the correct behavior, like apps that automatically switch
  on to prevent incoming notifications while in the car.
