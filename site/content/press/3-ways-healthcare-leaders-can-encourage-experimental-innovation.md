date: '2019-10-30'
summary: >-
  "Successful innovation requires experimentation," the article's authors
  concluded. "But healthcare change requires we tinker with the healthcare
  system we depend on, affecting critical resources organizations understandably
  protect. To support the people determined to drive change quickly, we need to
  find ways to bend institutional norms safely." Authors include David Asch, Roy
  Rosin and Kevin Mahoney. Several of the programs referenced use Way to Health.
