title: The Promise of Behavioral Economics for Health

summary: >-
  The promise of behavioral economics for health is that many of the same
  messages, incentives, and choice structures used so effectively to lure people
  into situations where they may be exploited can be redirected to attract them
  to healthier choices that improve their well-being. Health programs are more
  likely to be successful if designed not based on how perfectly rational people
  ought to make health decisions but on how humans actually make them.
