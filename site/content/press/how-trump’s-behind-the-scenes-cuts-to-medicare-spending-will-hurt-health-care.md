title: How Trump’s behind-the-scenes cuts to Medicare spending will hurt health care
date: '2018-02-21'
summary: >-
  Medicare spending accounted for 15% of federal spending in 2016. It is
  projected to reach 17.5% of federal spending by 2027. If we are to slow the
  rate of growth in Medicare spending over the longer term, it will likely
  require some unpopular limits on beneficiary access, convenience, and
  generosity of coverage.
