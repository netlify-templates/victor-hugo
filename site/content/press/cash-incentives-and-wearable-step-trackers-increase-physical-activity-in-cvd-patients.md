  patients

summary: >-
  Combining financial incentives, personalized goal setting and wearable devices
  might be an effective way of encouraging heart disease patients to engage in
  more physical activity. During the 9 to 16-week period, patients in the
  intervention increased their steps by 1,368 more steps per day than patients
  in the control group. After financial incentives were stopped at 16 weeks,
  participants in the intervention still had an increase of 1,154 steps per day
  more than the control group over the ensuing eight weeks.
