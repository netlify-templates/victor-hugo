  Intervention
date: '2018-01-31'
summary: >-
  Highlights the importance of also sharing the losses along with the wins -
  "*In large part, I am happy because it got published in a leading medical
  journal: JAMA Internal Medicine. Kudos to the editors for publishing a
  “failed" trial. Trust me, there’s no failure in doing good science. The real
  failure would have been to allow this important study to go unpublished
  because the intervention didn’t work*".
