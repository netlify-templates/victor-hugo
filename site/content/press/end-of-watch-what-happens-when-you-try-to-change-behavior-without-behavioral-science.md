  But there aren’t a lot of fitness trackers infused with legitimate behavioral
  science, says Patel. While plenty of apps use gamification strategies, those
  strategies tend to be ill-conceived, based on standard economics and the idea
  that people are rational. “They think about all the different possibilities,
  and ‘How much will this cake or this gym workout add to my overall life,’ and
  then make a decision,” Patel says. “But we know people don’t do that.”
