summary: >-
  Humans are social animals, and providers can use those social connections as a
  driving force for better patient engagement.  Peer support and coaching
  programs can lead to better care management for patients with chronic
  conditions, for example, said David A. Asch, M.D., executive director of Penn
  Medicine Center for Health Care Innovation, and Michele E. Heisler, M.D.,

  Michigan, during an event hosted by NEJM Catalyst.
