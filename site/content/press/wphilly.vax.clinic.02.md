  Black church leaders, health systems organize mass vaccination site in West Philadelphia
date: '2021-02-13'
summary: >-
  More than 500 people registered to get vaccinated at a West Philadelphia church on Saturday, the first of three planned mass vaccination sites created by area hospitals in partnership with neighborhood faith leaders. This was done in partnership with multiple faith based and health care organizations - including Penn Medicine and Mercy Health. “We set forth on creating a clinic that would promote accessibility while using novel principles of no/low tech to ensure we would provide an environment in a day when anyone and everyone would have access to it,” said Dr, Kathleen Lee. “And use this concept to inform additional clinics.” W2H is proud to have supported this low tech / no-tech effort.
