  Another success of the Heart Safe Motherhood program powered by Way To Health.
  The text messaging system increased the compliance rate to 93%, compared with
  just 30% of those asked to return to the office after hospital discharge. Just
  as importantly, it completely erased racial disparity in compliance rates,
  compared with white women, with more than 90% of both groups complying.
