title: Nudge Units to Improve the Delivery of Health Care
date: '2018-01-18'
summary: >-
  Opportunities for effective nudges abound in health care because choice
  architectures guide our behavior whether we know it or not. As more health
  care decisions are made within digital environments where they can be
  witnessed and their context can easily be reshaped, nudging opportunities
  expand. It doesn’t take much investment to support such expertise, and given
  the value of its applications, most health systems would be well served by
  insourcing it. We owe it to our patients to do the same for health care.
