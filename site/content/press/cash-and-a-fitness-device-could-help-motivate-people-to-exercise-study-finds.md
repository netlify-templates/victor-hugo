  A new study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association said
  the trackers — when paired with a little cold, hard cash — might just give
  people that push to start a regular exercise routine.


  “Framing rewards as a loss — a technique from behavioral economics — led to a
  meaningful difference in behavior,” said Dr. Mitesh Patel, an assistant
  professor of medicine and health care management, and director of the Penn
  Medicine Nudge Unit. “During the six-month trial, the average patient in the
  intervention arm had step counts that totaled about 100 miles more than the
  average patient in control.”
