title: 'CHIBE Combats the Opioid Crisis, One ‘Nudge’ at a Time'
date: '2018-06-14'
summary: >-
  Given the urgency of the opioid epidemic, the latest round of connected health
  pilot programs run by CHIBE in conjunction with Penn’s Clinical and
  Translational Research Award (CTSA) – which is based at Penn’s Institute for
  Translational Medicine and Therapeutics (ITMAT) – prioritized pilot projects
  focused on reducing harm from opioids. As Dr.  Kevin Volpp noted, “If the
  ideas we test are sufficiently bold, some will likely be unsuccessful, but
  that’s okay if across projects we make progress.”
