title: Engineering Social Incentives for Health

summary: >-
  Health care organizations, newly focused on population outcomes, can develop
  and test social interventions for advancing health. Given the increasing
  evidence that behavior is contagious, there’s good reason to believe that such
  models could work. You are more likely to smoke if people close to you smoke —
  and more likely to quit if they quit. Yet most health care interventions are
  designed for the individual. For some time, doctors have recognized that some
  patients’ social connections have a beneficial effect on their health. Now,
  doctors and hospitals can develop new approaches to prescribe social
  engagement for everyone else.
