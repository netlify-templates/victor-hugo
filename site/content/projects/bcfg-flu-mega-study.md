summary: >-
  This was a mega trial with a 150,000 patients across Penn Medicine and
  Geisinger Health system. The intent was to simultaneously test out 20
  different nudges to figure out how to increase flu vaccination rates. The
  secondary intent was to use learnings from this to inform COVID vaccination
  efforts. The best perfoming nudge increases uptake by 11% over previous year
  baselines. The study was replicated with Walmart with 800,000+ participants.
