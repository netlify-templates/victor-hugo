summary: >-
  This was a mega trial with 50,000 patients across Penn Medicine and Geisinger
  Health system. The intent was to simultaneously test out 20 different nudges
  to figure out how to increase flu vaccination rates. The secondary intent was
  to use learnings from this to inform COVID vaccination efforts. The best
  perfoming nudge increases uptake by 11% over previous year baselines. The
  study was replicated with Walmart with 800,000+ participants. 
results:
  - result: Increased uptake by 11% over baseline
  - result: Text messaging effectiveness
features:
  - feature: Arms and randomization
  - feature: EHR integration (appts)

Many Americans fail to get life-saving vaccines each year, and the availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 makes the challenge of encouraging vaccination more urgent than ever. This program was a large field experiment (N=47,308 with recruitment still ongoing) testing 19 different nudges delivered to patients via text message and designed to boost adoption of the influenza vaccine. Working closely with Penn Medicine and Geisinger Health Sytem, Way to Health integrated to the respective EHRs (EPIC) to automatically enroll participants based on upcoming primary care appointments and other inclusion and exclusion criteria. 

19 different arms (interventions) were built and participants randomized across them. The program went live on Sept 24, 2020 and recruitment is still ongoing. The initial findings are derived from data collected up to December 31, 2020.  

Findings suggest text messages sent prior to a primary care visit can boost vaccination rates by up to 11%. Overall, interventions performed better when they were (a) framed as reminders to get flu shots that were already reserved for the patient and (b) congruent with the sort of communications patients expected to receive from their healthcare provider (i.e., not surprising, casual, or interactive). The most potent intervention reminded patients twice to get their flu shot at their upcoming doctor’s appointment and indicated it was reserved for them. This successful script could be used as a template for campaigns to encourage the adoption of life-saving vaccines, including against COVID-19.
