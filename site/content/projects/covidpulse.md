summary: >-
  COVID Pulse was designed partly in response to reports that some patients with Covid-19 have little dyspnea, despite concerning hypoxemia (low blood oxygen). This program enrolls patients from emergency departments with depressed oxygen saturations, providing them with pulse oximeters, and escalates to care based on declines in measured oxygen saturation.
