summary: >
  Text conversations to monitor patients’ ostomy output levels after an ileostomy procedure. Patients can send in output values throughout the day, whenever they empty their ostomy bag. We calculate their levels over varying hours to determine total output and compare against thresholds. If these reported outputs are above or below thresholds, the patient’s care team is alerted.
