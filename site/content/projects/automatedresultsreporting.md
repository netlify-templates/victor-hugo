summary: >-
  COVID tests are conducted in advance of procedures or as part of occupational health. These results needed to be communicated to patients in a timely manner. While they were also communicated via the patient portal, immediacy is critical and not all patients have the app installed and activated. Phone calls from a nursing team were expensive and time consuming. An automated system to communicate negative test results (the majority) was put into place to optimize resources while ensuring patient communication.
