I am a Ph.D. candidate at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) working
with [David Karger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Karger) in the
[Haystack Group](http://haystack.csail.mit.edu). My current research
interests focus on applying HCI methods to help non programmers understand,
gain insights from, and explain the data in their lives. Most recently I've
been building intelligent user interfaces for doctors in the emergency room
at [BIDMC](https://www.bidmc.org/).

I was previously the undergraduate head of the [Graphics
Lab](http://cs.brown.edu/research/ptc/#/) at Brown University where I helped
developed NuSyS, a collaborative and shared workspace environment, and Dash,
a Document IDE for knowledge work. I've also spent summers at SpaceX and
Google where I worked with the database team and
[DataCommons](http://datacommons.org/) respectively.

In my spare time I like to try weird little projects like writing syntax
highlighters for obscure languages and automating everything. If you want to
see some more of my work check out my [projects]({{< relref "/projects" >}})
or [posts]({{< relref "/posts" >}}). If you would like to see my CV please
[reach out to me](mailto:{{< param email >}}).
