I'm Luke Murray and currently I'm researching interactive tools to help people
understand and explain information. I am a Ph.D. candidate working with
[David Karger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Karger) in the
[Haystack Group](http://haystack.csail.mit.edu).

I was previously the undergraduate head of the [Graphics
Lab](http://cs.brown.edu/research/ptc/#/) at Brown University where I helped
developed NuSyS, a collaborative and shared workspace environment, and Dash,
a Document IDE for knowledge work. I've also spent summers at SpaceX and
Google where I worked with the database team and
[DataCommons](http://datacommons.org/) respectively.

In my spare time I like to try weird little projects like writing syntax highlighters for obscure languages and automating everything.
