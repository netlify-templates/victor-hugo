                    bearing
                    contracts, proven solutions to reduce readmissions is critical. Leverage evidence based models to
                    reduce
                    readmissions in your context. Programs such as Heart
                    Safe Motherhood have shown readmisions reductions from 5% to 1%.</p>

                    still
                    dependent on procedures. Whether it is colonoscopy prep or post joint replacement surgery, programs
                    such as
                    Engaged Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) have been proven
                    and shown to increase adherence while still achieving 80+ Net Promoter Score (NPS) ratings. </p>
